    <h1>The Python Cookbook</h1>

      This website is a twist on an assignment from <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project.</a> Orignally, the assignment was to create a recipe book styled website. Rather than spending my time looking up recipes to use for this mock recipe book, I figured I would use the same format as the assignment to log my practice doing a "100 Days of Python" challenge.

    <h2>The Assignment</h2>
    <p>
      In detail, the original assignment is to make a recipe book website that is made up of several pages. The landing page following a bunch of recipe pages each detailing how to make certain dish with pictures, animations, etc. Since cooking isn't my forte, and I don't really have interest in making a project I'm not interested in, I thought that I could make a kind of psuedo-blog in the style of a cookbook where each recipe on the webpage is a small python exercise. I plan to do everything that is listed on the original assignment still, it will just be about learning how to code rather than learning how to cook.
