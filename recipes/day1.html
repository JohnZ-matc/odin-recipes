    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>This assignment was my very first program learning python outside of the standard print("Hello, World!) program. Assuming you know a little bit about syntax already, the things I needed to learn are as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Print Function</li>
        <li>The Input Function</li>
        <li>Concatenation</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Once you have learned to print to the terminal, you're about half-way there. Using the "Input Function" allows the user to send data in the form of a string to the computer. If we name that input function with a variable, we'll be able to print that back to the terminal. For Example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            streetName = input("What street did you grow up on? \n")
        </li>
        <li>
            print(streetName)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Now that we have print() and input() we have to learn about, concatenation or specifically "string concatenation." To simplify, to concatenate is to link two things together. So in the world of python when we concatenate two strings, it means to link one string with another, i.e. "snow" and "ball" concatenated is "snowball." To do this, we simply use the "+" operand. Example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            a = input("What is the white stuff that falls during winter? \n")
        </li>
        <li>
            b = input("What's round and rhymes with fall? \n")
        </li>
        <li>
            print(a + b)
        </li>
    </ul>
